# Flutter Testing Journey 

Learning Flutter unit, widget, and integration testing.

## Testing
Testing is the process of verifying that application components function as intended - without crashing, producing errors, or exhibiting any unintended behavior.

## Types of Testing

There are two types of testing methods.

### 1) Manual Testing

This method involves finding and resolving bugs in your Flutter application yourself.

> *"In manual testing, Superman is born — with his superpower, he detects and destroys all the bugs... until Batman is seen at 3 AM."*

### 2) Automated Testing

Automated testing is a way to prevent the software from **expected bugs**.

> *"In automated testing, the software has bugs — but it does not have **expected** bugs. It's that simple."*

## Why Manual Testing over Automated Testing

> *"Nothing to see here... seriously, skip this."*

## Why Automated Testing over Manual Testing 


Imagine you're the creator of a big e-commerce application. With **manual testing**, you need:

- A team of testers
- Big salaries
- Less productivity
- Error-prone results
- Time-consuming processes

With **automated testing**, application components are written along with tests for known bugs — solving all these demerits.

## Types of Automated Testing 

Flutter supports three levels of automated testing.

- Unit Tests 
- Widget Tests 
- Integration Tests 

### 1) Unit Tests 

A unit test is a test that verifies the behaviour of an **isolated piece of code** - a single function, method or class. No Flutter framework, no real database , no network calls. Just pure logic.
